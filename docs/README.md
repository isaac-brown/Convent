# What is Convent?

Convent is a suite of applications and libraries used to generate commit messages which adhere to the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Motivation

Sometimes you might find yourself needing to generate random commit messages which follow the conventional commits specification. You might want to play around with branching and versioning strategies, or tooling which uses conventional commits to generate changelogs or other release artifacts. In cases such as this you can use Convent to generate messages which follow the specification, but are random.

{% hint style="info" %}
Convent is not intended to create commit messages for use in real projects, you should write those yourself ðŸ™‚
