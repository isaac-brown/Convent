This is a guide for developing Convent itself. If you want to develop applications using Convent see [Convent.Commits](https://github.com/isaac-brown/Convent/tree/d54fac673a0829519f933efe7d820a3e4bcd072f/docs/convent.commits). If you want to work with an existing implementation, see [Convent.Cli](convent.cli/) or [Convent.WebApi](convent.webapi/).
